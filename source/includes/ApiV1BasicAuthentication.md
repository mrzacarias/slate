# Basic Authentication

All API requests requiring authentication must have an authorization header with a valid API token.
The token is generated by the rails server, when the credentials are correct.
Each key will be saved on the server until the user logs off using that key.

> Authorization Header

````
Authorization: Token token="123456......abcdef"
````

## Login

> Request Body

````
{
  "email":"user@eyenetra.com",
  "password":"password"
}
````

> Response Example 

````
{
  "info": "Success",
  "token": "e6d21171662392915a6f093fb078ada6",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "user",
    "lastName": "user",
    "email": "user@eyenetra.com",
    "superAdmin": false,
    "canAdmin": false,
    "canPrescribe": false,
    "appointments": [],
    "locale": "en-US"
  },
  "organization": {
    "id": 1,
    "logo": "assets/images/eyenetra-brand.png",
    "prescribers": true,
    "plan": "professional",
    "created_at": "2016-06-20T19:51:40.064Z"
  }
}
````

The API Login uses email and password as the credentials to generate a token, that will be returned on the response body.
The request also returns the user and organization information, which can be used to customize the user experience.
Multiples logins are permitted, creating a key for each login.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://insight-api.eyenetra.com/api/v1/login`

### Body Parameters

Parameter       | Description
--------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
email           | The email used on the sign up
password        | Password (8 or more characters, at least 1 number)


## Logout

The API logout is a DELETE request. The API will use the token on the authorization header to do the log off logic.
After login off, the key used for that will be deleted.
With the multiple login logic, after logging off with one key, the possible other keys and sessions will not be affected.
